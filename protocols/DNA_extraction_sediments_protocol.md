#### Protocol: DNA extraction from Everglades sediments


**Sample homogenization**

Weigh out 0.35-0.4g of sediment into a 2ml locking centrifuge tube.
Try to keep frozen throughout this process
Once sediment is weighed out, proceed immediately to lysis steps.

**Solution prep:**

- Lysis buffer I
    - 400µl of TE buffer (pH = 10) per sample
    - 25µl of lysozyme A

**Lysis**

- The physical lysis will be done through successive freeze-thaw cycles, along with some chemical and enzymatic digestions.
- Since homogenization of the sample has already been done by grinding, we can avoid the bead-beating step.
- After all the samples have been weighed out, thaw them and add 150µl of 0.2M pyrophosphate solution, then vortex the sample.
- Add 425µl of Lysis buffer I and mix again.
- Incubate at 37˚C on shaking incubator (100RPM) for 45 minutes, then freeze on dry ice.
- Thaw samples, then incubate at 50˚C on a shaking incubator (100RPM) for 1hr.
- After incubation, the sample will be frozen at -80˚C again for at least 30 minutes.

- The sample will be thawed at room temp, then 125µl of 10% SDS will be added.
- Incubate samples at 50˚C on a shaking incubator (80RPM) for 1hr.
- After incubation, the sample will be frozen at -80˚C again for at least 30 minutes.

- Thaw samples at room temp.
- Add 250µl of 5M NaCl and vortex sample briefly.
- Add 100µl of 10% CTAB and 15µl of 10% PVPP.
- Incubate samples at 68˚C on a shaking incubator (80RPM) for 1hr.

**Extraction**

- Add 750µl of phenol:chloroform:IAA to the sample, and mix by hand for 3 minutes.
- Spin down at max speed for 5 minutes.
- Pipette supernatent into new tube.
- Rinse sample with 750µl of chloroform, then spin down for 5 minutes again.

**Purification**

- Add 800µl of isopropanol at room temperature.
- Incubate for 2 hours at room temperature.
- Spin down for 25 minutes.
- Pipette off supernatent and add 1ml of 70% EtOH.
- Mix and spin down for 20 min.
- Pipette off EtOH and allow to dry.
- Resuspend in 200µl NF-H2O by incubating at 50˚C in water bath.
