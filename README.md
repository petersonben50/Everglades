### Readme file for Everglades incubations project

This project folder contains the scripts used in the analyses of the Everglades incubation project.
This project folder is not intended as an automated pipeline to re-analyze all the data from scratch; rather, it is meant as an archive that I or other interested parties can use as a resource for future analyses, or that others can use to evaluate the analyses presented in the manuscript.
This manuscript is currently under review.

Data availability: All ambient geochemical data used in this manuscript are included in the data release (not yet published). Raw data from the MeHg formation assays are provided in Table S3 of the manuscript. Raw metagenomic sequences have been deposited in the Sequence Read Archive from the National Center for Biotechnology Information under BioProject accession ID PRJNA808433. The fasta files from the metagenomic assemblies and those containing the hgcA-containing bins described in the manuscript are stored on the Open Science Framework (OSF) in the project folder: https://osf.io/8muzf/. Metadata spreadsheets for the assemblies and additional information about each hgcA-containing bin is included. A fasta file including all dereplicated hits against the HgcA HMM, along with the HgcA alignment used for tree generation and the RAxML output and run parameters are also in the OSF project folder. Scripts for all analyses are available at https://github.com/petersonben50/Everglades.
